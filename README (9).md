## Description
The `Live-Sketecher-` project provides real-time sketch filter applications using OpenCV and Streamlit. It includes two primary implementations: one using standard thresholding and another using adaptive thresholding to generate sketch-like effects from webcam input.

## Features ✨
-   **Real-time Sketch Generation**: Applies a sketch filter to live webcam footage.
-   **OpenCV Integration**: Utilizes OpenCV for image processing tasks such as color conversion, blurring, and edge detection.
-   **Streamlit UI**: Provides an interactive user interface for starting and stopping the webcam stream.
-   **Adaptive Thresholding**: Includes an alternative implementation that uses adaptive thresholding for edge detection.



## Tech Stack 💻
-   Python
-   OpenCV (`cv2`)
-   Streamlit (`streamlit`)
-   NumPy (`numpy`)



## Installation 🛠️
1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Talha4543/Live-Sketecher-.git
    cd Live-Sketecher-
    ```

2.  Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python streamlit numpy
    ```



## Usage 🚀



### Real-time Sketch Filter with Streamlit
1.  Run the `liveSketch.py` script using Streamlit:

    ```bash
    streamlit run liveSketch.py
    ```

2.  Open your browser to the address displayed in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:8501`).
3.  Check the "Start Webcam" box to begin the real-time sketch filter.
4.  Press the **Stop** button in the top-right corner to stop the application.



### Real-time Sketch Filter with Adaptive Thresholding
1.  Run the `liveSketch_adaptiveThresholding.py` script:

    ```bash
    python liveSketch_adaptiveThresholding.py
    ```

2.  A window will appear displaying the sketch filter applied using adaptive thresholding.
3.  Press `q` to quit the application.



### Use Cases
*   **Fun**: You can use it for creating funny sketch videos of you or your friends.
*   **Education**: It can be used to demonstrate basic image processing techniques and real-time video processing.
*   **Creative**: Creating live sketch filters can be integrated into creative projects like digital art or interactive installations.
